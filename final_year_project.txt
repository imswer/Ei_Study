The classification of cancerous tissues is critical
in medical diagnosis and treatment planning, especially when
dealing with complex tissue structures. Accurate classification of
cancerous tissues is a cornerstone of precision medicine, enabling
early detection and personalized treatment plans. In this work, we
present a novel deep learning framework for the classification of
Whole Slide Images (WSIs) of cancer tissues, specifically focusing
on lung cancer, esophageal cancer, and breast cancer, using
datasets from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Leveraging
powerful deep learning architectures such as Convolutional
Neural Networks (CNN), ResNet, and KimiaNet, we perform
robust pre-processing and feature extraction to capture intricate
patterns in histopathological images. A key innovation in our
approach lies in the application of advanced image segmentation
techniques, which highlight and isolate tumor regions within
the WSIs. This segmentation not only enhances the focus on
pathological regions but also reduces noise, thereby improving
the modelâ€™s accuracy and generalization in classifying cancerous
tissues. Our preliminary results show significant improvements in
classification accuracy and computational efficiency, demonstrat-
ing the potential of this approach to transform digital pathology
by assisting pathologists with automated, high-precision cancer
diagnostics.
